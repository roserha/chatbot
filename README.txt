Okay! This is how you can set up RickyHBot, for whenever you forget how to do it:

1- Activate YouTube by logging in as Ricky Horizon, and then as RickyHBot
2- Track chat to track it, untrack to untrack it (duh)
3- That's it, I think! :)

http://localhost:2505/ will give you the bot's control panel page :)
